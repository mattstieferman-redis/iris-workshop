# Docker Workshop Template

A ready-to-use template for creating browser-based coding workshops. Clone it, customize it, and build your own workshop in minutes! Well, maybe not minutes, but it sure is cool looking.

## What Is This?

This template provides a complete workshop environment that runs entirely in Docker with an integrated workbench interface. Attendees get everything they need in one browser window:

- 📚 **Documentation** - Step-by-step instructions
- 💻 **Code Editor** - VS Code in the browser
- 🚀 **Live Preview** - See changes instantly
- 🖥️ **Terminal** - Command-line access
- 🗄️ **Redis Insight** - Database visualization

Perfect for teaching web development, APIs, databases, or any coding topic!

## This Repo: Redis Iris Workshop

This copy of the template runs the [Redis Iris demos](code/iris/README.md) (Semantic Routing, LangCache, Agent Memory, Context Retriever). Before the first `docker compose up`, nothing else is needed; once it is running, fill in the credentials in `code/iris/.env` and run `make setup` in the Terminal panel (see `docs/setup/setup.md`). The demo starts without an OpenAI key (chat replies that the key is missing) and the backend restarts itself when `.env` changes.

## Try the Demo

See what your attendees will experience:

1. **Clone and start:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/workshop-docker-template.git
   cd workshop-docker-template
   docker compose up
   ```

2. **Wait for services to start** (you'll see "ready in X ms" from Vite in the logs)

3. **Open the workbench:**
   ```
   http://localhost
   ```

You'll see a unified interface with:

- **Left sidebar:** Workshop documentation
- **Right panels:** Code editor and a live app preview

**Try it out:**
- Edit `code/web/index.html` in the Code panel
- Watch changes appear instantly in the App panel

There are other panels including a terminal and Redis Insight. They are hidden by default but can be shown by clicking the menu button in the top left corner.

Getting a little crowded? Open any panel in a new browser tab if you prefer (URLs shown in the workbench)

## Building Your Own Workshop

### Step 1: Clone and Customize

```bash
# Clone this template
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/workshop-docker-template.git my-workshop
cd my-workshop

# Remove the original git history if you want to start fresh
rm -rf .git
git init
```

### Step 2: Update the Workbench Title

Edit `workbench/config.js`:

```javascript
const config = {
  title: "My Awesome Workshop",  // ← Change this
  // ... rest of config
};
```

### Step 3: Write Your Workshop Content

**Documentation** (`docs/` folder):
- Edit `docs/home.md` - Your workshop welcome page
- Edit `docs/setup/*.md` - Setup instructions
- Edit `docs/tasks/*.md` - Workshop exercises
- Edit `docs/reference/*.md` - Reference materials

Docsify automatically renders your markdown as interactive HTML.

**Starter Code** (`code/web/` folder):
- Edit `code/web/index.html` - Starting HTML
- Edit `code/web/style.css` - Starting CSS
- Edit `code/web/main.js` - Starting JavaScript
- Update `code/web/package.json` - Add dependencies your workshop needs

### Step 4: Test Your Workshop

```bash
docker compose up
```

Open http://localhost and go through your workshop as a student would.

### Step 5: Add More Services (Optional)

Need another service? You'll need to update three files:

**1. Add the service to `docker-compose.yml`:**

```yaml
services:
  # ... existing services ...

  myservice:
    image: myservice:latest
    container_name: workshop-myservice
```

Note: Services don't need exposed ports — they're accessed through the workbench proxy.

**2. Add a proxy route to `workbench/nginx.conf`:**

```nginx
location /myservice/ {
    proxy_pass http://myservice:8080/;
    include /etc/nginx/proxy/proxy-params.conf;
}
```

If your service uses WebSockets, also add:
```nginx
    include /etc/nginx/proxy/proxy-params-websocket.conf;
```

NOTE: Tools like vite, which we are using, use Websockets for hot module replacement. So, even though your code is not using WebSockets, the server might.

If your service has long-lived connections that might exceed nginx's default 60-second timeout (e.g., long-running API), also add:
```nginx
    include /etc/nginx/proxy/proxy-params-long-running.conf;
```

⚠️ **Trailing slash warning:** The trailing slash in `proxy_pass` matters!
- With slash (`http://host:port/`): strips the location prefix from the request
- Without slash (`http://host:port`): preserves the full path

Most services work with the trailing slash. Some (like Vite, Redis Insight) need the path preserved — check the service's documentation.

**3. Add a panel to `workbench/config.js`:**

```javascript
panels: [
  // ... existing panels ...
  {
    id: 'myservice',
    name: 'My Service',
    path: '/myservice/',
    icon: 'fa-cube',
    visible: true
  }
]
```

### Step 6: Deploy

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed instructions on deploying this to PS Portal.

### How It Works

The environment runs six Docker containers, all accessed through a single nginx reverse proxy on port 80:

1. **workbench** (port 80)
   - Nginx reverse proxy serving the unified workbench interface
   - Routes all services via paths (e.g., `/vscode/`, `/app/`, `/terminal/`)
   - Same-origin access eliminates iframe security issues

2. **vscode** (accessed via `/vscode/`)
   - VS Code running in your browser (code-server)
   - Mounts the `code/` folder for editing
   - No authentication required (configured with `--auth none`)

3. **web** (accessed via `/app/` and `/terminal/`)
   - Vite development server with hot module replacement
   - Web-based terminal (ttyd) for command-line access
   - Automatically installs npm dependencies on startup

4. **docs** (accessed via `/docs/`)
   - Nginx serving Docsify documentation
   - Renders markdown files as interactive HTML
   - Updates in real-time when markdown changes

5. **redis**
   - Redis database for workshop exercises
   - Accessible from the web container at `redis:6379`

6. **redisinsight** (accessed via `/redisinsight/`)
   - Redis Insight GUI for database visualization
   - Pre-configured to connect to the workshop Redis instance

**Path-Based Routing:**

All services are accessed through the workbench nginx proxy using paths instead of ports. This approach:

- Makes all iframes same-origin, avoiding X-Frame-Options issues
- Exposes only a single port (80), simplifying deployment
- Works seamlessly with platforms like PS Portal

**File Synchronization:**

- VS Code edits files in `code/web/`
- Vite watches `code/web/` for changes
- When you save in VS Code → Vite detects the change → Browser hot-reloads

**Security Note:** VS Code only has access to the `code/` folder, not the root project directory. This prevents accidental modification of `docker-compose.yml` or other infrastructure files.

### Using the Workbench

**Panel Controls:**
- **Drag dividers** between panels to resize
- Click the **refresh button** (↻) to reload a panel
- Click the **eye button** to hide a panel
- Click the **maximize button** (⛶) on any panel for full-screen

**Showing Hidden Panels:**
- Click the **☰ menu button** (top-left) to show/hide panels

**Opening in New Tabs:**
- Click the **open in new tab button** (↗) in the panel header to open the panel in a new tab 

Useful for multi-monitor setups or when the workbench gets too crowded.


### Stopping the Environment

```bash
docker compose down              # Stop services
docker compose down -v           # Stop and remove all data
```

## Common Customizations

### Editing config.js

The `workbench/config.js` file controls which panels appear in the workbench:

```javascript
const config = {
  title: "My Workshop",  // Displayed in the header

  sidebar: {
    id: 'instructions',
    name: 'Instructions',
    path: '/docs/',      // Path through nginx proxy
    icon: 'fa-book'
  },

  panels: [
    {
      id: 'vscode',
      name: 'Code',
      path: '/vscode/',  // Path through nginx proxy
      icon: 'fa-code',
      visible: true      // Show by default
    },
    // ... more panels
  ]
};
```

**Panel fields:**
- `id` - Unique identifier
- `name` - Display name in header and menu
- `path` - URL path (must match a route in nginx.conf)
- `icon` - Font Awesome icon class
- `visible` - Whether shown by default (can be toggled via menu)

### Editing nginx.conf

The `workbench/nginx.conf` file defines proxy routes for each service:

```nginx
location /myservice/ {
    proxy_pass http://myservice:8080/;
    include /etc/nginx/proxy/proxy-params.conf;
}
```

Each panel's `path` in config.js must have a matching `location` block in nginx.conf.

⚠️ **Trailing slash warning:** See the comments in nginx.conf — the trailing slash in `proxy_pass` changes behavior significantly.

### Adding More Documentation

Docsify supports:
- Multiple markdown files (automatically linked)
- Sidebar navigation (`docs/_sidebar.md`)
- Navbar (`docs/_navbar.md`)
- Cover page (`docs/_coverpage.md`)
- Custom themes and plugins
- Search functionality

Just add `.md` files to `docs/` and they'll be rendered automatically.
